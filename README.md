# Hangman-AIPowered
The game is a Hangman game implemented using Python and pygame, powered by artificial intelligence. It was developed as a group project and serves as a basic rendition of the classic Hangman game. Initially, players have the option to choose the source of the words, either from AI or from our database. While the AI feature was in beta in the previous version, it now operates effectively. Below this selection, there are three buttons for choosing the difficulty level. At the bottom of the screen, you can find the names of the group members.

When you select an option, the color of the buttons changes, as indicated below.

When you guess a letter wrong, a part of the man's body will pop up and appear. We divided the body into six parts: the head, body, right arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg.
